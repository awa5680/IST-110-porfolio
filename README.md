<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me:</h2>

- <b>I'm a security risk analysis (SRA) major with a focus of cyber security. I grew up around central PA, some of hobbies include painting, working out, running and boxing.  </b>
- <b>I choose the major SRA because growing up I was fascinated with computers and being online, ultimately I decided that protecting peoples sensitive information online is something that would always keep on edge and interested in doing for a long time.  </b>
<h2>Course overview</h2>
 <b>

Over the semester in IST 110, we covered a wide range of topics that helped me build a solid understanding of IT. We started by looking at the history of computers and learned the difference between the World Wide Web and the internet which honestly cleared up a lot of confusion. We also got into binary code and practiced how to read and break it down, which was pretty cool since it showed how computers actually process information.
On top of that, we explored computer hardware and the basics of operating systems.  learning about their functions, different types, and real-world use cases. We also touched on programming, then worked our way from machine languages all the way up to high-level languages and even got some hands-on experience with Python.
Toward the end of the course, we spent time learning about data organization, the role of applications and the importance of privacy in today's tech world. Overall, the class really gave me a strong foundation in understanding how the technology we use every day actually works behind the scenes.
