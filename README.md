  <h1>Hi, I'm Abdul Mohamed!</h1>

  <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me:</h2>
  <p><strong>I'm a Security Risk Analysis (SRA) major focusing on cybersecurity. I grew up around Central PA, and some of my hobbies include painting, working out, running, and boxing.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>I chose SRA because I‚Äôve always been fascinated with computers and being online. The idea of protecting people‚Äôs sensitive information keeps me interested and challenged.</strong></p>

  <h2>üìö Course Overview</h2>
  <p><strong>Throughout IST 110, we covered a wide range of topics. We began with the history of computing and the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet. I also learned binary code, explored hardware, operating systems, programming languages like Python, data organization, and the importance of privacy and security. This course gave me a strong foundation for understanding how technology works behind the scenes.</strong></p>
